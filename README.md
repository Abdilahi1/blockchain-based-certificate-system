## ✨ Features
- 🔒 **Secure Credential Issuance** – Certificates are stored on the blockchain to prevent tampering.  
- ✅ **Instant Verification** – Employers and institutions can validate credentials in real time.  
- 📜 **Smart Contract (Solidity)** – Handles certificate storage and verification logic.  
- 🖥️ **User-Friendly Web App** – Frontend built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
- ⚡ **Python Backend (Flask + Web3.py)** – Connects the frontend with the Ethereum blockchain.  
- 🗄️ **SQL Database Integration** – Stores additional certificate metadata.  
- 🧪 **Ganache Integration** – Local blockchain environment for development and testing.
